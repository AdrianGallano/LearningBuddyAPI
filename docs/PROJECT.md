<h2 id="INTRO">Introduction:</h2>

<p>
  21st century – a modern age powered by interconnected network of wires, an age
  with technologies that can power or harm you. Despite the modernization of
  most industries, we somehow forgot to develop the educational system. The
  inefficiency of our current education system is tolerated, wasting not only
  money, but huge amount of time, and talent. But this doesn’t mean that we
  normal nerds can’t create solutions, and that doesn’t necessarily mean we have
  to fight our current education system. Instead, we could leverage our
  technology by taking advantage of our freedom to use and create our own.

<p>
  I believe that in-order to achieve great things you need to use tools
  purposely designed with information acquired from research studies targeted to
  the specific subject, such as learning habits.
</p>

<p>
  “Learning buddy” is simply a web application designed using the information
  acquired from multiple research studies that has been concluded in the areas
  of maximizing the learning efficiency of the learner.

<h2 id="PURPOSE">Purpose:</h2>
