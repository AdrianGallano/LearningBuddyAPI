<h2 id="INTRO">Introduction:</h2>

<pre style="color:white">
    21st century – a modern age powered by interconnected network of wires, an age with technologies that can power or harm you. Despite the modernization of most industries, we somehow forgot to develop the educational system. The inefficiency of our current education system is tolerated, wasting not only money, but huge amount of time, and talent. But this doesn’t mean that we normal nerds can’t create solutions, and that doesn’t necessarily mean we have to fight our current education system. Instead, we could leverage our technology by taking advantage of our freedom to use and create our own.

I believe that in-order to achieve great things you need to use tools purposely designed with information acquired from research studies targeted to the specific subject, such as learning habits.

“Learning buddy” is simply a web application designed using the information acquired from multiple research studies that has been concluded in the areas of maximizing the learning efficiency of the learner.
